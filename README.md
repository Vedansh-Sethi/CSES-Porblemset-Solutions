# 🧠 CSES Problem Set Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions to the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/), which aligns with the [Competitive Programmer’s Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf).

This repo is my structured grindset zone to level up core competitive programming skills, one clean solution at a time. 🚀

## 📁 Structure of the Repository

This repository mainly includes **two folders**:

1. **`solutions/`** – Contains clean, commented code for each problem. Filenames are problem-specific for easy lookup.
2. **`notes/`** – Includes key takeaways, tricks, and logic breakdowns to help cement understanding.

Each problem has:
- 1 solution file
- 1 notes file

✅ **For best clarity, read both files together.**

## ⚠️ A Humble Request

Please try solving the problems *on your own* first. This repo is meant to **guide**, not replace, your learning.

Let's keep the CP grind honest, focused, and high-signal. GLHF.
